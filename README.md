# Persian-English Cognates: Shared Indo-European Roots

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive study of Persian (Farsi) and English words that share common Proto-Indo-European (PIE) roots. The project demonstrates the linguistic kinship between these two languages through comparative etymology and historical phonetics.

## Contents

The main research is presented in the file [`shared_roots.md`](shared_roots.md), which includes:

- **250+ word pairs** with shared Indo-European origins
- **Detailed etymological analysis** for each word pair
- **Phonetic transformations** from PIE to both languages
- **Cognate words** in related languages
- **Structural similarities** between Persian and English
- **Sound change patterns** and paired consonants

## Research Foundations

This study is based on:
- **Comparative Etymology**: Analysis of sound and semantic changes over time
- **Historical Linguistics**: Study of language evolution from common ancestral language
- **Historical Phonetics**: Analysis of sound laws in Indo-European languages
- **Comparative Studies**: Comparison of lexical and grammatical structures

## Key Features

### Main Table Structure
Each entry includes:
- Persian word with phonetic transcription
- English word with IPA pronunciation
- Common PIE root
- Etymology explanation
- Sound changes to English/European languages
- Sound changes to Persian (including Avestan, Middle, and New Persian stages)
- Related cognate words

### Additional Sections
- **Structural Similarities**: Common linguistic patterns between Persian and English
- **Sound Changes**: Detailed analysis of phonetic transformations and paired consonants
